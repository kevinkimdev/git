The __Dart Bag-of-Tricks__ ( __BOT__ ) is hosted on [pub.dartlang.org](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bot_io). Add the **bot_io** package to your `pubspec.yaml` file, selecting a version range that works with your version of the SDK. _Always check the [bot_io page](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bot_io) on pub to find the latest release._

See the [changelog](https://github.com/kevmoo/bot_io.dart/blob/master/changelog.md) to find the version that works best for you.

# Versioning

* We follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
* We are not planning a V1 for **bot_io** until Dart releases V1.
	* In the mean time, the version will remain `0.Y.Z`.
	* Changes to the _minor_ version - Y - will indicate breaking changes.
	* Changes to the _patch_ version - Z - indicate non-breaking changes.

# Dart SDK dependency

* We're going to try to keep **bot_io** in line with the [latest integration build](https://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/) of the Dart SDK and Editor.
* At this point, each SDK release tends to introduce breaking changes, which usually require breaking changes in **bot_io**.
* Keep an eye on the [changelog](https://github.com/kevmoo/bot_io.dart/blob/master/changelog.md) to see how **bot_io** aligns with each SDK release.
